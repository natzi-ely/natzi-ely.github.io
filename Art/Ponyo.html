      <p>A goldfish princess meets Sosuke, a human boy, during a forbidden trip to explore the surface world. Sosuke gives her the name Ponyo. Ponyo longs to be human, and as her bond with Sosuke deepens, she begins to resemble a person. Ponyo's father returns her to their kingdom by the sea, but her desire to live on the surface is so great that she manages to break free and spill a number of mystical elixirs that put Sosuke's village in jeopardy.
